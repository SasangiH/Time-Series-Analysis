Time Series Analysis

Develop a time series forecasting project to predict daily sales using SARIMA and XGBoost models. Using a dataset of daily sales and discount percentages from January to April 2023, I developed and tuned both models and evaluated their performance using RMSE and MAPE. This project compare classical and machine learning approaches to time series forecasting.
